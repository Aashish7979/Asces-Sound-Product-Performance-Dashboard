Here’s a proposed **Data Analytics Project Roadmap** based on the email request:

---

### **Project Name**: Department Budget and Performance Analytics Dashboard  

### **Objective**:  
To create an interactive and comprehensive Power BI dashboard that evaluates department budgets, monitors project performance, and identifies risks of overspending or underperformance. The analysis will provide actionable insights to ensure departments meet budgetary constraints set over a two-year interval and address potential performance issues.

---

### **Scope and Deliverables**:  
1. **Key Question**: Which projects and departments are at risk of being over budget or underperforming?  
2. **Deliverables**:  
   - Dashboard showing:  
     - Departments and projects exceeding or falling short of budgets.  
     - Performance metrics like employee efficiency and salary distribution.  
     - Budget utilization trends over the two-year interval.  
   - A structured, accessible dataset containing employee information, salary data, department budgets, and project details.  
   - Insights and recommendations for corrective action.

**Tools**: PostgreSQL (data preprocessing), MS Excel (data exploration), Power BI (dashboard development).

### **Roadmap**  

#### **Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation**  
**Tasks**:  
- **Data Collection**: Gather datasets from multiple sources, including:  
  - Employee information (performance metrics, roles, etc.).  
  - Salary data (department-wise and role-specific).  
  - Department budgets and project details.  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Eliminate duplicates and inconsistencies.  
  - Handle null values in critical fields like budget allocation and salary data.  
- **Data Structuring**:  
  - Format data for analysis (e.g., standardize salary structures, normalize dates).  
  - Use SQL joins to establish relationships between datasets.

---

#### **Phase 2: Data Analysis**  
**Key Metrics and Analyses**:  
- **Budget Utilization**: Calculate how much of the budget has been spent relative to the allocated amount.  
- **Performance Indicators**: Analyze employee productivity and department-wise salary efficiency.  
- **Trend Analysis**:  
  - Track year-over-year budget utilization and performance trends.  
  - Highlight deviations from expected spending or productivity benchmarks.  
- **Risk Identification**:  
  - Pinpoint departments and projects at risk of overspending or underperforming.  
  - Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Dashboard Development**  
**Design and Features**:  
- **Interactive Visuals**:  
  - Bar charts for department-wise budget utilization.  
  - Line charts for budget trends over time.  
  - Heatmaps highlighting high-risk areas (e.g., over budget, underperformance).  
- **Filters and Slicers**: Enable users to filter data by department, year, and project category.  
- **Key Views**:  
  - Overspending Projects: Highlight projects exceeding their budgets.  
  - Underperforming Departments: Identify areas with low employee productivity or inefficient salary distribution.  
  - Two-Year Budget Projection: Provide insights into whether departments can sustain expenses within the set interval.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Deployment and Handover**  
**Steps**:  
- Publish the dashboard in Power BI for stakeholder access.  
- Document the data preparation process, SQL queries, and key findings.  
- Provide training sessions for the management team to interpret and utilize the dashboard effectively.

---

### **Outcome**:  
This project will empower Asces Sound’s management to:  
- Detect early signs of overspending and underperformance.  
- Optimize budget allocation across departments.  
- Improve employee productivity and salary efficiency.  
- Ensure strategic and data-driven project management.
